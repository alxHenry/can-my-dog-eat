# Can Dogs Dine

https://candogsdine.com

App to quickly help dog owners determine if a food item is edible for their dog. The app is designed to acquire users through search engine results, instead of users exploring the site itself. That may change over time.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

Pushing to the "production" branch will automatically kick off a build and deploy to production at https://candogsdine.com.
